// e2e we never show the window at all: it's never mapped to a display, and
// Playwright drives the renderer over CDP. A hidden window throttles its rAF
// loop, so the renderer is instead made deterministic without a visible window
// elsewhere (e2eHarness zeroes CSS animations; canvas nodes are created already
// idle; node removal is finalized immediately) so the drag specs stay reliable.
