// useWorkspacePanelTree — the single source of truth for "what panels does this
// workspace contain, and where do they live". Reads the workspace panel registry

// store, so the result is multi-canvas- and dock-aware and excludes ghosts
// (records placed nowhere) and panels detached into other windows.
//
// Both the sidebar workspace overview (WorkspaceTab) and the Cmd+K command
// palette consume this, so the two can never disagree about which panels exist
// or where they are.
