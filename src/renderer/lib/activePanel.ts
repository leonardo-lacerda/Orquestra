// =============================================================================
// activePanel — the one canonical fact about focus: which panel the user last
// activated, anywhere (a canvas, a docked tab, a split pane). It replaces the
// two parallel globals it grew out of — `activeCanvasPanelId` (which canvas is
// active) and `activeSurface` (canvas vs which dock stack) — with a single id.
//
// Everything else is DERIVED from it (see lib/workspace/canvasAccess.ts):
//   - getActiveCanvasPanelId() — the canvas to route canvas shortcuts to
//   - placementForActivePanel() — where a Cmd+T / Cmd+N panel should be created
//
// Granularity is the PANEL id, and for a canvas surface that id IS the canvas
// panel (a canvas is itself a center-zone dock tab). That's deliberate: a
// canvas-type active panel derives to "default canvas placement", while a
// docked panel derives to "tab into that panel's stack" via the dock store's
// panelLocations. So canvas-vs-dock disambiguation falls out of the panel type
// — no pointer-event capture/bubble ordering trick needed.
//
// Written from the real interaction surfaces: pointer-down on a canvas
// (CanvasPanel) or a dock stack (DockTabStack), a dock tab click, and the
// workspace/layout/session transitions that re-point it at the incoming canvas.
//
// A zustand store (not a bare module var) so reactive consumers can subscribe.
// Module-scoped, so it is automatically per-renderer-window: a detached panel /
// dock window has its own independent active panel.
