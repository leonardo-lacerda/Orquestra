// builtinWallpapers — wallpapers that ship inside the app, so the user can pick
// one straight from Settings without browsing the filesystem.
//
// A built-in selection is stored in the same `canvasBackgroundImagePath` setting
// as a custom pick, but tagged with the `builtin:` prefix (e.g. `builtin:foo`)
// so it's distinguishable from an absolute filesystem path. The images are Vite
// asset imports, so they resolve to bundled URLs and render directly in the
// renderer — no main-process round-trip (CANVAS_READ_BACKGROUND_IMAGE) needed.
//
// Currently empty: the previous "Hillside" pack was removed. Users pick a custom
// image via Choose… instead. Keep this module so new built-ins can be added later.
