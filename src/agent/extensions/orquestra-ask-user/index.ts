// =============================================================================
// orquestra-ask-user — a first-party Orquestra extension that gives the agent an
// `ask_user` tool. When the model needs decisions or clarifications it can't
// safely assume, it calls ask_user with one or more questions (each a choice or
// free text); the tool blocks until the user answers, then returns the answers
// as the tool result so the model continues with them.
//
// Why a tool (not a slash command): the AGENT initiates the questions mid-turn,
// the way Claude's own question tool works. That only fits a tool the model can
// call.
//
// How the UI works: pi's RPC mode only exposes select / input / confirm as
// interactive primitives (custom() — arbitrary TUI components — is stubbed out
// when pi runs headless under Orquestra). Since one ask_user call can carry several
// questions with multi-select, we do a SINGLE ctx.ui.input round-trip whose
// title carries a JSON envelope (marker below). Orquestra's renderer decodes it,
// shows a multi-question form, and returns the answers as a JSON string in the
// response value. pi passes that value through untouched (it never validates it
// against an option list), so we get the full structured result back.
