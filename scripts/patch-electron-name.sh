# install leaves the `electron` package without its downloaded binary — no dist/
# or path.txt — and `electron-vite dev` then fails with "Error: Electron
# uninstall". Materialize it directly via Electron's own installer (the download
# is cached globally, so this is ~1s after the first machine-wide install). This
# is a no-op on npm installs, where the binary is already in place.
