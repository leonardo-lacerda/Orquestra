# Import the Developer ID Application cert (CSC_LINK / CSC_KEY_PASSWORD) into a
# dedicated temporary keychain, add it to the user search list, and export the
# identity hash (ORQUESTRA_MAC_SIGN_IDENTITY via $GITHUB_ENV) so build-runtime-
# tarball.mjs can codesign the bundled native binaries (node, rg, node-pty's
# pty.node + spawn-helper) BEFORE packing them.
#
# Why: Apple's notarytool recurses into runtime-host.tgz and rejects unsigned
# Mach-O ("not signed with a valid Developer ID certificate"), so the daemon
# binaries must carry a Developer ID + hardened-runtime signature like the app.
#
# The keychain is added to the search list so codesign can locate the identity
# (codesign --keychain alone is unreliable). electron-builder later signs the app
# with its OWN --keychain, so this extra keychain doesn't make that ambiguous.
#
# No-op (exit 0, no identity exported) when MAC_CERTS is absent — the build then
# stays unsigned and notarization fails loudly, same as before.
